              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Cicero packs 81,000 residents into just 5.9 square miles, creating one of the most densely populated communities in Illinois. This density means your wrapped vehicle gets seen by more potential customers per mile than almost anywhere else in Chicagoland. Add in the thousands of commuters who pass through Cicero daily on their way to and from Chicago, and you have a marketing environment that delivers extraordinary visibility for every advertising dollar invested.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mt-8 mb-4">Cermak Road Commercial Corridor</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Cermak Road serves as Cicero's main commercial artery, carrying heavy traffic from Chicago's west side through the heart of the community. Your wrapped vehicle traveling this route reaches not just Cicero residents but also customers from neighboring Chicago neighborhoods who come to Cicero for shopping, dining, and services. This cross-community traffic multiplies your exposure opportunities throughout the day.

                Cicero's location immediately west of Chicago provides easy access to the city's massive customer base while maintaining the operational advantages of suburban location. Your wrapped vehicle can serve both markets effectively, reaching urban customers who appreciate suburban businesses' often superior customer service and suburban customers who value city-level expertise and capability.
